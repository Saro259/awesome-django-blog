          Know anyone with a medical grade EEG to monitor their sleep? That's the kind
          of stuff I do! My goal in life is to optimize my faith, family, friends, and
          career so I am 1% better every day in every way. I have my B.A. in GIS and
          Remote sensing from UC Santa Barbara and a M.S. in Geoinformatics and
          Geospatial Intelligence (that's a mouthful!) from George Mason University.

          My master's thesis on Team Spatial Cognition was funded by the Army Research
          Institute. Team Spatial Cognition is the idea that groups of people can
          communally develop shared maps in their heads. If you want to learn more,
          check out my thesis!

          I created this blog as a way to strengthen my web development skills and share
          my thoughts with the world. Stay tuned for updates!
