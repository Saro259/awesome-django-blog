            I had the pleasure to hire, onboard and manage John. I have nothing but great things to say about him as
            both a professional employee and direct report. He is so passionate about learning, collaborating with other
            team members to make a better work environment and goes above and beyond for our customers...

            There is a right way to come into an organization and John did it the right way. He jumped into the product
            and got up to speed quickly. He reached out to many throughout the organization to learn and grow. He
            delivered for customers, documented his findings to benefit others, and earned the respect of his peers,
            both technical and customer-facing...

            John was an extraordinary TA to me as a student in an introductory GIS class. His enthusiasm for Geography
            and all things related is palpable and contagious. He was always knowledgeable and excited to help tackle
            difficult concepts, projects, or errors...He was, by far, the best TA I have ever had.

            Not only is John the kind of guy you'd trust with all things IT based on his technical prowess, but he's
            genuinely a good person to his core, leaving you trusting him on a multitude of levels. John is amazingly
            bright, levelheaded, and goal-oriented, which translated into him consistently delivering results internally
            and directly to our customers...
